For this web project, a business e-commerce website was created to showcase the principles of HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The website, Invictus Wine, requires customers to enter their login details, which are then validated before receiving a summary of their order. 
The login feature was implemented using JavaScript. 
A slideshow carousel, which displays a different image each time the page is loaded, was included on the banner. 
An object array in JavaScript was used to display product images and information. 
In the original project, a database was connected using PHP/XAMPP. However, the functional webpage, which is deployed on Github, has replaced the database with a JSON file.
